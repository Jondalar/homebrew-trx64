# Binary formula: it installs the release archives built by TRX64's own CI rather than
# compiling on the user's machine. A source build would mean ~20 minutes of 433 crates,
# most of it a bundled DuckDB C++ amalgamation, for every install and every upgrade.
#
# Homebrew's core repository does not accept binary formulae, which is one of the reasons
# this lives in a tap. The other is that TRX64 vendors reSID and bundles DuckDB on purpose,
# so the binaries run without any further installation — exactly what core would ask us to
# undo.
#
# A pleasant side effect on macOS: Homebrew fetches with curl, and curl attaches no
# com.apple.quarantine. So these binaries start without notarization and without the
# `xattr -d` dance a browser download would need.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      TRX64 ships no C64 ROMs and never will — they are Commodore's property, not ours
      to distribute. Six files, ~68 KB, normally a copy of a set you already own.

      Point the binaries at yours, in this order of preference:

        trx64cli --rom-dir /path/to/roms          per invocation
        export C64RE_ROOT=/path/to/c64re          then <that>/resources/roms is used

      Do NOT rely on a roms/ folder next to the executable here: that path lives inside
      the Homebrew Cellar and a `brew upgrade` replaces it.

      The daemon speaks one WebSocket (default port 4340) carrying video, audio and a
      JSON-RPC monitor:

        trx64-daemon --port 4340
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/trx64cli --version")
    assert_match version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/trx64-daemon --version")
  end
end
